Explain the key thinking and design decisions for each Hazard in here

Where multiple options for a single Hazard exists explain the differences below.


## Spiked Log Trap (Shen Edition)
This was a rebuild of the Spiked Log trap, changing the disable DCs, reducing the damage dealt on a hit, and the area it hits, to better align with the CR of the trap. While trying to maintain the feel of the original source book. Also, damage is stringently specified of how much for each type, to be better defined for any resistances/immunites.

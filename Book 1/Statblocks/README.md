# NPC and Monster Statblocks
Using http://monster.pf2.tools/ you can import/export and share JSON files for your custom made creatures. Please share those JSON files here along with the PNG and PDF file downloaded from the monster builder tool.

The PDF and PNG files should be linked in the Book README.md file, for example (remove the space between the square and round brackets to use)

![Arctic Tatzlwyrm PDF] (./Statblocks/arctic_tatzlewyrm.pdf)
![Arctic Tatzlwyrm PNG] (./Statblocks/arctic_tatzlewyrm.png)

Please remove the number from the end of the filenames downloaded from monster builder so that updates to the monsters do not require an update to the Book README file.

Explain the key thinking and design decisions for each creature in here

Where multiple options for a single monster exists explain the differences below.

## Monster Builds

### Arctic Tatzlewyrm
- Creature has modified stats from the base Tatzlwyrm, and possesses above Extreme cold resistance for it's level. The Natural Camouflage ability is further altered and renamed to suit the arctic environment.

### Arctic Tatzlewyrm Shen Edition
- Creature has almost the same stats as the base Tatzlwyrm but the Natural Camouflage ability has been modified to the arctic environment, and Craft has been replaced with Survival. 

### Winter-touched Sprite Fighter
- Creature is based on Sprite but leveled up and damage type changed to cold.

### Winter-touched Sprite Shen Edition
- Creature is a basic sprite with the Winter-Touched Shen Edition template applied

### Fawfein, Winter-Touched Atomie
- damage types changed to cold.

### Fawfein, Winter-Touched Atomie Shen Edition
- Atomie rebuilt from the ground up, and given the Winter-Touched Shen Edition template. The non-template stats are similar, but slightly different, in just about every part of the creature

### Talking Stag
- Loosely based on riding horse.

### 'Ten Penny' Tacey
- Basic rogue-npc build with a half-orc ability.

### Rokhar Cindren
- Rokhar is built roughly as a warpriest cleric, has 1 uncommon item (lethargy poison).  This is to emulate the oil of taggit he has in 1e, GMs who don't want to give access to this poison should find a suitable common substitute.

### Frost Fir
- The sticky resin ability is largely unchanged from 1e, clumsy seems the most apt condition to give out.  Sickened would work more out of the box but an exception would be made to allow for eating and drinking while affected.  In the interest of not making new special rules for conditions I went with clumsy instead.

### Hommelstaub
- Based on pixie family.  The oracle stuff did not come through since it was so weakly tied to his character anyways.

### Mierul
- Spell list is a mix of occult and primal, mostly for thematic reasons.
